Definitions
•	Abstraction
This is defined as the general model of something. It is a very important aspect of object oriented programming in C++. Abstraction displays the more essential information and leaves out the details that refer to other less relevant parts of the object. For example, a vehicle can prove an abstraction. When we drive, we know how to drive a car, and we know that pressing the accelerator will increase the speed of car, while pressing the brake will terminate movement. However, very few people actually know how a vehicle works or know what all its components are. 

•	Attributes / Properties
An attribute acts as an instruction to the compiler which provides additional information about the code for optimization purposes and enforcing certain conditions on it. It is an object’s data item, and it is stored in a member variable.

•	Class
A class is a programmer-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions. These functions can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A C++ class is like a blueprint for an object. It also describes how the objects generated from it will look. As an example, an animal class. There are numerous animals, but they all have similar features such as legs, ears, color, weight etc. In this case, the class will be animal, and the properties will be legs, ears, color and weight. 

•	Class Variable
  
•	Composition
Creating objects of your existing class inside a new class is called composition, because the new class is composed of objects of existing classes.

•	Encapsulation
Encapsulation refers to binding together data and the functions that manipulate them. It is simply putting together an object’s data and procedures. For example, having different departments in a workplace, and one section wanting to access data from another section. 

•	Friends
A friend function of a class is a function that is defined outside that class scope, but it has the ability to access all members of the class that are private and protected. A friend is usually a function, function template, or member function, or a class or class template.

•	Inheritance
Inheritance is where a class has the ability to derive properties and characteristics from another class. A class that inherits properties from another class is called sub class, and a class whose properties are inherited by a sub class is called base Class.

•	Instance Variable
Instance variables are defined within a class but outside of any method, so for any instance of a class they are global in scope. That is, they can be referenced by any method in the class instance.
•	Member Variable
A member variable is a naming convention that is usually associated with a specific object, and is accessible to all the related functions.
•	Method
Methods are functions that belong to the class. It can also be defined as the procedures performed by an object.

•	Multiple Inheritance
Multiple Inheritance is when a class can inherit from more than one other classes. The constructors of inherited classes are called in the same order in which they are inherited. 
•	Object
An Object is an instance of a Class; it is created from a class. A class object can be passed as an argument to a function. When defining a class, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated. 

•	Overloading
Function overloading is where a function can have more than one definitions i.e. it has the ability to share a name, but have different parameters.

•	Polymorphism
The word polymorphism means having many forms. Polymorphism can be defined as a message being displayed in more than one form. Code is considered polymorphic when different behavior is generated when different types of data is entered.

•	Public / Private / Protected
Private: A private member function can only be called from a function that is of the same class. 
It is not allowed to be accessed directly by any object or function that is outside of the class. Private functions can be accessed by member functions or the friend functions only.

Public: These class members are accessible to everyone and other classes at any point in the program (using the direct member access operator).

Protected: Protected access is similar to private however, these members are inaccessible outside the class, but they can be accessed by any derived class of that class.

•	Virtual
Virtual function allows for the most specific member function in an inheritance hierarchy to be used for execution. Virtual functions make polymorphism possible. Virtual functions ensure that the correct function is called for an object. The type of reference (or pointer) used for the function call does not matter.
